My interest in espresso began exactly 5 years ago. 

15 years prior to that I began paying attention to coffee, since a good experience seemed so elusive.  I eventually arrived at an optimized Kalita Wave pour-over method with fresh-ground beans.   5 years ago we got ourselves a basic Nespresso and started drinking that every day.   The quality was fairly good, if limited (e.g. not as good as Starbucks), but a bit expensive and then there's all those used aluminum capsules.

4 years ago I plunged into real home espresso with a Breville Infuser semi-automatic machine, where I would tamp freshly ground beans (Bartza Vario burr grinder) into a portafilter and brew real espresso under pressure, with milked frothed with actual steam.   I hadn't realized how easy it would be to far surpass the quality of what I could get at Starbuck if I controlled more of the process myself.

There were various limitation of that entry-level set-up that I had a chance to address when the Breville died a year ago.

Now I use an Izzo Vivi semi-automatic machine (heat exchanger, E61 brew group) and a Eureka Mignon Specialita flat burr grinder, both of which I recommend.  All from Seattle Coffee Gear, which until recently had a store two blocks from where my Dad now lives in Bellevue.  It is great fun and I'm drinking maybe a bit too much coffee now!  

Naturally there is plenty of room to climb up from here. Some may have pressure profiling machines for which you can design the brew pressure vs time function to suit flavor nuance preferences.  I'm not tempted by that at the moment. My current experiment is with a coffee distributor tool.  Theories later.

Disposable plastic has become a scourge and must now be avoided as much as possible by everyone.  However, re-usable plastic for food can also be problematic.

In recent years there has been concern about BPA in plastic containers leaching into contents and causing health risks. Water bottles and food containers often now advertise "BPA-free".  Of course, there are ingredients other than Bisphenol A in plastic, used as a substitute or otherwise.  Lack of evidence is not evidence of lack.

Heat and acid apparently accelerate the breakdown of plastics, so I've long stopped putting plastic food containers in the dishwasher, and in fact replacing plastic food storage with glass to the extent possible.

Hot coffee, being both hot and acidic, should be kept away from plastic at all times.

I recall reading years ago that the CEO of Chock Full O'Nuts was quoted as saying that the only thing coffee should touch is glass or rinsed paper.
One could also ask about the path of the water used to make the coffee, but too much is out of one's control until it leaves the tap (and enters the users water filtration technology of choice).

You mostly need metal to heat water, so the best one can do is to try to control the materials in contact after the hot water combines with the coffee. The idea is to prefer paper, ceramic, or glass, tolerate stainless steel, and disqualify any method that brings hot coffee into contact with plastic.

Pour-over, like Chemex, Kalita Wave, or Hario V60, is ideal for this -- IF you use a glass or ceramic dripper with a rinsed paper filter, over a server of glass or ceramic.  If, as is common, you find yourself with a plastic dripper, you are disqualified.  

Automatic drip coffee machines these days have plastic shower heads and plastic filter baskets, bringing boiling hot coffee into extended contact with plastic. Plastic is so cheap, light, unbreakable, and practical in other ways, that I don't think I've ever seen any qualified Mr-Coffee-style machines. Which is a shame since they are so convenient and inexpensive, and are often quite ok making brewed coffee.  The old-fashion metal coffee percolator may remain eligible if the percolator window is glass, assuming the basket isn't aluminum.

This now leaves us with espresso.  There is no way to avoid contact with stainless steel in order to arrive at the required brew pressure. 
For the moka pot there is extended exposure to the metal of the pot, either steel or aluminum. Therefore preferred are semi-automatic machines. For those, the water itself usually comes from a plastic reservoir, which can be excused as a receptacle for cold water only.  Ground coffee in the portafilter is then forced through the basket under pressure.  Hot coffee spends perhaps 30 seconds or less in contact with the steel parts of the group head, portafilter, and basket, before draining down into a (ceramic or glass) cup.

The double boiler machines hold hot water in metal boilers, which is acceptable but less desirable than the heat exchanger type.  For those, cold water from the reservoir passes through the boiler on its way to the group head, so spends very little time as hot water in contact with metal before reaching the coffee.

What can you do at home to rescue your coffee from plastic?

1.  Avoid capsule machines that produce disposable plastic capsules as waste.
2. Do not use automatic drip coffee makers -- even the high end ones have plastic filter baskets.
3. For an inexpensive, high-quality solution, use a pour-over method, but avoid plastic drippers in favor of glass or ceramic. Avoid plastic kettles. Use glass or ceramic cups.
4. A second inexpensive option is the French Press, if constructed of steel and glass. The lack of need for filters balances the slightly higher entry cost. 
5. For the hobbyist, most semi-automatic espresso machines qualify, with a preference for heat exchanger type.  Here there are also no filters to buy, but the entry cost is significant.

A benefit of this corrective action is that your coffee will be far better than before. On the other hand, you will have to spend more time making coffee. I find the slower methods to be helpful to my state of mind -- meditative, and encouraging me to focus on something simple, the mindful preparation of a daily beverage.

My last post on this topic, {% post_url 2020-05-17-coffee-vs-plastic %}, needs two important updates regarding drip and pod coffee makers.

I've come across an automatic drip machine that doesn't require a plastic brew basket:  the Breville Precision Brewer.  It comes with the default plastic filter basket, but, brilliantly, has the built-in option to make use of the users own glass or ceramic dripper, and glass carafe.  In that mode, it becomes an automatic pour-over device, allowing you to keep your hot coffee away from plastic throughout the entire brew process.  Kudos to Breville for this unique feature!

I have not seen this machine personally, but apparently it has user controls for temperature and other various things supporting proper pour-over practice.
Naturally, it costs more than a basic Mr Coffee-style machine, in the region of US$300.  So manual pour-over is still a tempting alternative for cost and control.

The second update is the availability of compostable pods for Nespresso machines. One such company is Pod & Parcel.  Pods still have an aluminum lid, which needs to be removed and separately recycled, but the main pod is claimed to be biodegradable and compostable.  This ups the acceptability level for Nespresso machines.  I have yet to sample one of these.

I still prefer my semi-automatic espresso machine for both exceptional flavor and lack of packaging waste compared to any pod machine.
